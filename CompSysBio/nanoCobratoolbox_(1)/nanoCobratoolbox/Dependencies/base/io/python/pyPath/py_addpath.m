function new_py_path = py_addpath(directory, MATLAB_too)
%Add directory to import search path for the instance of 
%the Python interpreter currently controlled by MATLAB
%
%EXAMPLE USAGE
% >> py_addpath('C:\Documents\ERPResults')
%
%REQUIRED INPUTS
% directory      - Directory to add the Python import search path
% MATLAB_too     - If true (or 1), directory will also be added to the
%                  MATLAB path. {default: false}
%
%OPTIONAL OUTPUT
% new_py_path    - a cell array of the directories on the updated
%                  Python path; to get this output without updating the 
%                  Python path, use an empty string as the input:
%                  py_path = py_addpath('')
