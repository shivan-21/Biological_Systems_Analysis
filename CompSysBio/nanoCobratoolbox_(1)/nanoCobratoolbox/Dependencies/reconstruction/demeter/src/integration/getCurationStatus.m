function curationStatus = getCurationStatus(infoFilePath,inputDataFolder,getComparativeGenomics)
% This function retrieves for each organism in a reconstruction resource
% whether the strain was refined based on experimental data and/or
% comparative genomic data. For experimental data, 2 indicates that the
% reconstruction was refined against available experimental data for the
% strain, 1 indicates that published studied were available for the strain 
% but no suitable data was found or all findings were negative, and 0
% indicates that no experimental data was available. For comparative
% genomic data, 2 indicates that genome annotations were refined for all 
% subsystems, 1 indicates that certain subsystems were refined, and 0
% indicates that no comparative genomic refinement was performed.
% the file with curation status information will be saved as a file called
% curationStatus.txt in the inputDataFolder.

% USAGE:

%           curationStatus = getCurationStatus(infoFilePath,inputDataFolder,getComparativeGenomics)
%
% INPUTS
% infoFilePath:             File with information on reconstructions to refine
% inputDataFolder:          Folder with experimental data and database files to
% getComparativeGenomics:   Boolean indicating whether PubSEED spreadsheets 
%                           with information on the reconstructed strains are 
%                           available
%
% OUTPUT
% curationStatus:           Table with curation status of each model
